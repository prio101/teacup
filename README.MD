# CART SYSTEM [CodeName: TeaCup] â˜•

---

## Description

A simple cart system that will demonstrate the cart features with Ruby Code.
The cart system will have the following features:
- Add items to the cart
- Offer discounts
- Calculate total price
- Show Total Price for Cart


## Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required gems by running `bundle install`
3. Run the tests using `rspec` command
4. Run the application using `ruby main.rb`
5. You can type `help` to see the available commands
6. Follow the prompts to add items to the cart and finish by pressing `d` or `done` to see the total price


## Reasoning
The code is designed to be simple and easy to understand. It uses a class-based approach to define the cart system and its features. The main class is `Basket`, which contains methods for adding items, applying discounts, and calculating the total price.

Offers are defined in a separate class called `Offer`, which allows for easy management of different types of offers.

Products are defined in a separate class called `Product`, which allows for easy management of different types of products.

The `main.rb` file contains the main loop that interacts with the user and allows them to add items to the cart and see the total price.

This enables the code to be easily extended in the future by adding new features or modifying existing ones without affecting the overall structure of the code.
